					<h1>Interests in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">

				<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
			

<br></br>
            <p> From a young age I always enjoyed information technology in playing computer games, using social media, watching television, playing on my Game Boy, Sega, Play Station, Xbox and using my phone. Information technology is such an integral part of my life and everyone else’s lives. Information technology interests me as it is so significant to our daily lives it would be difficult to imagine a world without it.  I do not have any IT experience but have a close friend in the industry that is doing well financially, and they really enjoy their job. Also, my father was a program manager in IT so am hopeful that this could be a possible career path for me.
</p>

				<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
<br></br>
		  	<p>There is a lot about information technology I do not understand and would really enjoy learning about it to help solve problems, learning new skills, build things and use my creativity to design something. I choose to study online at RMIT because I had previously undertaken studies through it but in accounting. I do not have a passion or interest in accounting and am hoping studying in information technology will help with a career path in this industry.  </p>

			<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
<br></br>
			<p>I have enrolled in the unit Introduction to information technology at RMIT to help me determine whether IT is something that interests me and is something I want to pursue a career in. Should I decide to pursue a degree in IT I expect to learn about different types of programming, computer software, computer systems and databases, back end processing rather then front-end processing, hopefully something I enjoy to understand how I could build a career in IT.</p>

            <h3> Results of the Myers-Briggs Indicator (MBTI) test</h3>

            	<br></br>
            	<p>From the 16Personalities Myers-Briggs test, my personality type is the Assertive Virtuoso (ISTP-A), which stands for Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Perceiving.2  This personality type represents 5% of the population and is considered to be bold, practical, master of all kinds of tools, has an individualistic approach to life in that they are confident they know the best way to do something, enjoy creating, troubleshooting, trial and error and first-hand experience.<br></br>
My results from the individual traits is that I am 79% introverted, 73% observant, 72% thinking, 64% prospecting and 51% assertive. My strengths are being optimistic and energetic, creative and practical, spontaneous and rational, know how to prioritise, great in a crisis and am relaxed. My weaknesses are stubbornness, insensitive, private and reserved, easily bored, dislike commitment and risk behaviour.<br></br>
According to the test possible career paths suited to this personality type include mechanics, engineers, graphic designers, and forensic scientists. They are also well suited to jobs which require a crisis response, such as firefighter, paramedic, detective, pilot and a police officer.<br></br>
The results are not a surprise to me and a lot of this information they stated about this personality type I knew already. The most interesting thing about this result is the suggested career paths, some of which I had considered. In terms of workplace habits and how this profile may affect working in a team one of the top requirements for success is to have a sense of unpredictability and excitement. The virtuoso personality type is not naturally emotional or empathetic, and in some instances are blunt in the way they communicate with others which can lead to misunderstandings or hurt feelings. I will take this into account ensuring I communicate in a way that is less blunt to ensure I do not unintentionally cause misunderstandings.
</p>

<h3>Results of an online learning style test</h3>
<br></br>

	<div id="Kinesthetic" class="quickFade">

		</div>
		<div><a href="https://personalitymax.com/report/?ls=56-46-79&name_key=0529671621">Source: Personalitymax</a></p></div>

<p>From a PeronslaityMax test using the VAK model my learning style is made up of 44% kinesthetic, 31% visual and 25% auditory. As kinesthetic is my primary learning style it means that I learn best by doing. I am tactile and would rather participate than watch, I appreciate the opportunity to experience real world and on job learning, that I get satisfaction from building things with my hands, classes with physical experiments and that I can become restless without physical activity.3  <br></br>
As a kinesthetic learner it means I better at learning with hands-on experiences, rather than textbook learning. My secondary style of learning is visual where I learn best by seeing, including pictures, charts, diagrams, videos, observing from my surroundings and by converting spoken instructions into visual form by taking notes. This style of learner prefers classes and lectures to hear lessons and benefits from group discussions. <br></br>
As kinesthetic and visual styles are my preferred technics for learning I will use this for working in a group by ensuring I participate in the group discussions, utilizing, where possible, stand-up group meetings to ensuring I am not restless, take notes from lectures, study in short blocks, incorporate visuals and other images and illustrations.  
</p>

<h3>DISC personality test</h3>
<br></br>

<p>The DISC profile is a way of categorising four main behavioural traits and characteristics that are common for these categories.4  According to my DISC profile test I score highly in dominance and steadiness with a result of 43% dominance, 30% steadiness, 15% compliance and 11% influence.<br></br>
The DISC profile stands for the following:
<li>Dominance is the way people deal with problems, assert themselves and control situations.</li>
<li>Influence is about the way you deal with people, communicate and relate to others</li>
<li>Steadiness is about temperament in terms of patience, persistence, and thoughtfulness.</li>
<li>Compliance is about how you approach and organize your activity, procedures and responsibilities.</li><br></br>
A high dominance score means I am highly motivated by achieving results and success, I am direct, demanding, forceful, strong willed, driven, determined, self-confident, impatient, fearful of being vulnerable or taken advantage of and values competency, action, results, personal freedom and challenges.5  I am a self-starter, confident, risk taker, problem solver, prefer to lead rather than follow and prefer leadership and management positions.6
 <br></br>
I also have a high steadiness score, which means I am a person who is highly motivated by cooperation, opportunities to help, proritises giving support, collaboration and maintaining stability, am calm, patient, predictable, deliberate, stable and consistent, fearful of change, loss of stability and offending others and values loyalty and security. <br></br>
Apparently a high dominance and steadiness score is extremely rare as they are opposing sets of values and motivations.7  However, the motivating factors behind these two styles are related in that dominance is about power and control and steadiness is a need for certainty and avoid change.<br></br>
Working in a team taking into consideration these traits I will need to be more patient, sensitive of others in the group and allow for greater deliberation. I should also try and be quicker to adapt to change or unclear expectations, embrace multitasking and confront others where needed. For others in my team, according to this profile I receive communication better if others in my team are direct with me in giving me the bottom line, are concise and brief, avoid repetition and focus on solutions rather than problems.

		<div id="Loo" class="quickFade">

		<h3>Project overview</h3>
		<br></br>

		<p>My project idea is developing an App called “Find a Loo“ that will allow you to search and locate nearby toilets. The idea being whenever nature calls we will find the right loo for you. This App will be marketed as a convenience tool, as sometimes you need a loo in a hurry and are unfamiliar with the surroundings so do not know where the best places are to go in a hurry. The App will gather data from users and provide information about toilets functionality, user experience and review. The users of the App will have the ability to give ratings out of 5 stars, take and add pictures, pinpoint new locations of public toilets nearby, save favorite public toilets for the next time they are in town.</p>

		<h3>Motivation </h3>
<br></br>
		<p>I came up with this concept based on my experiences travelling and having to visit public toilets, but not knowing the cleanliness or which toilet was the best one in the area for privacy. It is illegal to urinate and defecate in public, and so there is a real need to help people to be informed of the location of facilities they can relieve themselves in a hurry. There are around 4.8 million individuals in Australia with bladder or bowel control problems, people with kidney problems, pregnant women, babies and others vulnerable members of the community that could benefit from this App. The Apps slogan will be - How often have you walked into an unpleasant toilet not knowing that around the corner a 5 star loo was waiting for you? </p>

<br></br>
		<h3>Description</h3>
<br></br>
		<p>The Department of Health already hosts a <a href="https://toiletmap.gov.au">National Toilet Map</a>, which is project of the National Continence Program. There is also several other Apps out there in the market including Where is Public Toilet, Flush – Find Toilets/Restrooms. However, this App will go further than just providing the locations of toilets, it will provide both 18,000 public and private access loos (such as restaurants, cafes, stores, petrol stations etc) and more importantly provide users of the App with much more data about the facilities and reviews of the particular loo.</p>

		<p><b>The Find a Loo App will provide the following features: </b></p>

		<p>
			<li>Location by reference to google maps, which can input directions on how to get there</li>
			<li>	Cleanliness reviews</li>
			<li>	Type of toilet paper including number of ply or warnings if there is no paper</li>
			<li>	Type of toilet in whether it is flushable, composting, bidet or a drop loo (such as those at national parks)</li>
			<li>	Accessibility specifications – male, female, unisex, disability and ambulant access</li>
			<li>	Presentation and mood of the loo, such as music playing</li>
			<li>	Lighting and acrostics</li>
			<li>	Water efficiency</li>
			<li>	Privacy and surroundings for people with anxiety issues</li>
			<li>	Comfort of seat</li>
			<li>	Additional features such as whether the loo has a baby changing table, showers, faucets with fresh drinking water, sharps and sanitary bins</li>
			<li>	Opening hours</li>
			<li>	Parking nearby</li>
<br></br>
			The users of the App will be made to feel like a community of loo supporters to help everyone be informed about toilet facilities in their time of need. It will be particularly important for the success of the App for users to make accurate and meaningful contributions to the dataset to ensure its most up to date and complete. The initial App launch will be Australian based only then revised to add additional countries/markets.

		</p>

		<h3>Tools and Technologies </h3>
<br></br>
		<p>In developing this App I would require the following software, hardware and other equipment:8 
<li>Application Program Interface to access Geolocation and Google maps.9</li>
<li>Application Program Interface to access to users GPS location data.</li>
<li>A route mapping software solution coded into the program.</li>
<li>Data security protocols and malware protection.</li>
<li>Mobile development software application such as AppyPie, bizness apps, ibuildapp and Appery.io. The software program would need to be compatible with the following platforms Android, iphone (IOS) and web-based.10</li>
<li>Cloud based data storage for user photos and comments and access to a server.</li>
<li>SQL database.</li>
<li>Integrated development environment such as Eclipse.</li>
<li>Open source CSS external librarys’ and plug-in software.</li>
<li>A computer with at least 2GB of RAM and 2GB hard disk space.</li>

</p>

		<h3>Skills Required </h3>
<br></br>
		<p>The main resource I would require is a full stack web developer who can develop both the client interface for the App and the back-end technology including the database, security protocols, APIs, and coding of JavaScript, CSS, HTML, SQL.11  I would also require an understanding of cloud based storage systems, data security skills and basic coding skills.  It would be feasible for me to hire someone to assist with the App build, but acquiring the necessary skills and knowledge would take some time and it would not be something I could initiate immediately.

There are some potential drawbacks and obstacles, including:
<li>	User uptake on the App in finding users in a niche market and promoting and marketing the App.</li>
<li>	Building an integrated map with high quality data and accurate location.</li>
<li>	Ability to have an App that is integrates with all platforms (e.g. Andriod, IOS).</li>
<li>	Continued App maintenance.</li>
<li>	Security of users’ information and privacy.</li>
<li>	Financial feasibility of the App as its proposed to be a free App for users and would require maintenance and other ongoing costs.</li>
<li>	Fixing bugs and glitches.</li>

</p>

		<h3>Outcome</h3>
<br></br>
		<p>The project would be successful if thousands of Australians download the “Find a Loo“ App and are able
to share data and utilise the information in the App to obtain up to date and accurate information on
public and some private access toilets. The impact of the App would hopefully lead to users of toilets
having a nicer user experience, be able to conveniently find the right type of toilet for their needs in a
hurry and the public would benefit from enhanced sanitation. Beneficiaries of the App include
individuals with continence issues and other potentially vulnerable members of the community,
travelers unfamiliar with their surroundings, government agencies including the Department of Health
and land planning authorities, local councils and national parks that could use the information to
identify dirty toilets that need cleaning, restocking of soaps and toilet paper or other maintenance issues
identified.</p>
